    "I'm not interested in what people think about me. I'm not Michael Schumacher.",
    "Is it on or not? The drink?",
    "Just leave me alone, I know what I'm doing.",

    "What the papers write about me afterwards makes me laugh.",
    "Yeah. I was having a shit.",
    "Yeah, yeah if he cannot see behind then he should stay on the reporting stuff and not drive."
